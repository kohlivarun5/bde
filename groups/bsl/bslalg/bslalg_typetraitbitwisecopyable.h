//@PURPOSE: Provide a trait to mark classes as bit-wise copyable.
//
//@CLASSES:
//  bslalg::TypeTraitBitwiseCopyable: bit-wise copyable trait
//
//@SEE_ALSO:
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a single traits class,
// 'bslalg::TypeTraitBitwiseCopyable'.  An object of a 'TYPE' that has the
// bit-wise copyable trait can be copied either by invoking the copy
// constructor or by copying the footprint (i.e., the 'sizeof(TYPE)' bytes at
// the object address) using 'memcpy'.
//
// Note also that this type is a synonym for having a trivial destructor, as in
// almost every case a bitwise copyable class does not need to perform any
// operation on destruction.  It is possible to write types that are
// operationally bitwise copyable (i.e., copy constructor can be implemented in
// terms of 'memcpy') but have a non-trivial destructor, but most examples of
// such types are contrived.  In any case, this trait should not be attached to
// such types.
//
// This component is used by various 'bslalg' components for providing
// optimized primitives for types that have the bit-wise copyable trait.  The
// major benefit of this trait is not for a single object but for an array of
// such types, as a loop can be replaced by a single call to 'memcpy'.
//
///What constitutes bit-wise copyability?
///--------------------------------------
// TBD: A short guide on when to attach this trait to a class should follow.
//
///Usage
///-----
// TBD

    // assumed to be bitwise moveable (see the 'TypeTraitBitwiseMoveable'
    // trait).  Undefined behavior may result if this trait is assigned to a
    // type that allocates memory or other resources, uses virtual inheritance,
    // or places pointers to itself within other data structures.  Also,
    // objects of a type with this trait can be destroyed by a no-op, i.e., not
    // invoking the destructor, although it is safe to write zeros into the
    // memory footprint of the object.
